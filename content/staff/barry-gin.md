Reverend Barry Gin was raised in the suburbs of Chicago and was formerly a mechanical engineer before going into ministry. It was during his college days at MIT that Barry felt the desire to serve the Lord full-time as a pastor instead of as an engineer. Because he also felt that it was beneficial to spend a few years getting real-world experience, he worked as a mechanical engineer for Hughes Aircraft Company in Los Angeles, CA after receiving his Bachelor's and Master's degrees. He later enrolled into seminary and received his Master of Theology (ThM) from Dallas Theological Seminary in 1996. While attending seminary, he started the English ministry at Plano Chinese Alliance Church and later served full-time as their English Pastor. He began serving as the English Adult Pastor at Living Water Evangelical Church in January of 2013.

He and his wife Christine have been married since 2003. They have two daughters, Xara and Keoni. Besides serving the church and being with his family, he enjoys music, all kinds of sports (especially golf and volleyball), playing with his Apple computers, and using coupons galour.
