Born and raised in NYC, Pastor Geoff graduated from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and then worked for 4 years in information technology at a Fortune 100 company. After receiving his call to full-time ministry, Geoff attended Trinity Evangelical Divinity School in Deerfield, IL, where he earned his MDiv and ThM. He oversees Overflow Youth Group after 5 years as a youth pastoral intern.

Geoff spends his free time reading, drinking coffee, and nerding out over sports (especially basketball and baseball)! One of his goals is to preach the gospel in each of the worldâ€™s seven continents before he dies (and yes, he recognizes that only penguins live in Antarctica - they need Jesus too!)
