        <p>Pastor Hui-Li Chang was raised in Taiwan. It was in high school that she received Jesus Christ as her personal Lord and Savior. Before receiving her Masters in Ministry from Moody Theological Seminary in 2012, she had attained her Masters in Chemistry and doctorate in Education. Her passion is to bring children to the saving knowledge of Jesus Christ, and to equip parents and teachers to raise their children as followers of Christ. Hui-Li serves side by side with her husband, Paul.</p>

<p><em>“to equip the saints for the work of ministry, for building up the body of Christ, until we all attain to the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God, to mature manhood, to the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ,”</em>
— Ephesians 4:12–13</p>

<p><em>“He has told you, O man, what is good; and what does the Lord require of you but to do justice, and to love kindness, and to walk humbly with your God?”</em>
— Micah 6:8</p>
