        <p>Reverend Tony Chon was born and raised in the Chicagoland area. After graduating from Northeastern Illinois University with a BA in Speech Communications, he attended Moody Bible Institute where he met his wife Ruth. After receiving his Masters of Divinity, he and his wife moved to Taiwan where he became the English Pastor at Tainan Holiness Church. After serving in Taiwan for a year, his family came back to the States with a calling into full-time youth ministry at a Korean church in Dallas, Texas. It was there where he received his ordination through ECA (Evangelical Church Alliance). After two years, God called their family back to Chicago where he has been the youth pastor at Living Water Evangelical Church in Naperville since 2011.</p>

<p>He also has four beautiful children: Hope, Hosea, Hudson, and Hosanna.</p>

<p>Pastor Tony is currently on a year-long sabbatical and will be back in September, 2018. Pastor Geoff Ng will be serving in his place.</p>
