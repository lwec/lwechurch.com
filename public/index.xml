      <description>Reverend Barry Gin was raised in the suburbs of Chicago and was formerly a mechanical engineer before going into ministry. It was during his college days at MIT that Barry felt the desire to serve the Lord full-time as a pastor instead of as an engineer. Because he also felt that it was beneficial to spend a few years getting real-world experience, he worked as a mechanical engineer for Hughes Aircraft Company in Los Angeles, CA after receiving his Bachelor&amp;rsquo;s and Master&amp;rsquo;s degrees.</description>
