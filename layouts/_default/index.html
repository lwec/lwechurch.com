          We are on the Southeast corner of 75th and Wehrli in Naperville (exact address: 1256 Wehrli Road, Naperville 60565). Worship
          services start on Sundays at 10:30am.

        <p class="lw14-landing-visitors-text">
          Parking is available at the church parking lot. But our community is expanding, so parking spots get filled and remote parking
          is available for latecomers at the east side of the Burger King located near the Northeast corner of 75th and Naper
          Blvd. A shuttle transports worshippers from the remote parking lot to the church until 10:45 AM or so, and then
          takes them back to the remote lot at 12:05-12:10 (or 5-10 minutes after the worship service is done) as well as
          after lunch from 12:50-1:00 PM.

          We have Sunday school programs for children of ages 4–11. For children 3 and under, there are babysitting rooms attended
          by volunteers. There is also a nursery room where audio from the worship service beams in.

          Our church caters from Chinese restaurants around the area. This provides us with an opportunity to sit down for a meal together
          after services. The cost for a plate is $3.00 ($1.50 for children). However, for first-time guests, lunch is on
          us!
